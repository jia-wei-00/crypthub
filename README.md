## Technologies Used

  A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. We use TypeScript with React for this project.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)\
  A fast and lightweight build tool for modern web applications. We use this building tool to speed up the development process.

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)\
  A widely used UI component library for React applications. We use this library for most of our components, such as inputs, containers, navigation bars, and more.

- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)\
  A library for creating smooth and interactive animations in React. We use this library to animate our transitions.

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)\
  A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests. We use this library to establish a connection with the backend server.

  A lightweight JavaScript library for date and time manipulation. We use this library to handle date and time conversions used in the history table.

- [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/)\
  A feature-rich charting library for interactive data visualization. We use this library to display live data on the trading page.

- [Intro.js](https://introjs.com/docs)\
  A step-by-step guide to introduce new users to the application's features. We use this library for our onboarding tour guide to familiarize users with our app's flow.

- [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)\
  A simple and scalable state management library for JavaScript applications. We use this state management library due to its excellent performance and simplicity. We use multiple stores in our project, such as mode-store, history-store, trade-store, and more.

- [Mobx Persist Store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx-persist-store)\
  A library for persisting Mobx store data. We use this to store user preferences like dark mode and light mode toggle value, and chart display settings.

- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)\

  A TypeScript-first schema validation library for runtime type checking. We use this validation library for all of our forms, such as register form, login form, reset password form, buy form, sell form, and more. We use Zod combined with react-hook-form and Material UI input to minimize rerendering while performing proper validation and displaying error messages returned from the Zod library.
